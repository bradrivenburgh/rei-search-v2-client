            Real estate investment decisions should always begin with proper due
            diligence. This app is meant to be used by investors interested in
            buying rental real estate in and around Philadelphia, PA. Users will
            be able to discover and evaluate key statistics about the population
            and economy of municipalities in this geography. They will also be
            able to view properties for sale and save them for later viewing.

          <h4>Get marketplace statistics</h4>
          <p>
            The app produces statistical data on three geographic levels:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan
                Statistical Area:
              </strong>{" "}
              MSAs are large geographic regions centered around areas of high
              population density (i.e., big cities) with integrated economies.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
            <strong>County:</strong> moderately-sized geographies
              that provide context for more granular census tract data.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Census Tracts:</strong> small geographic units
              used for statistical purposes by the US Census Bureau. CT data may
              provide investors with valuable insights into the desirability 
              of a neighborhood.
            </li>
          </ul>
