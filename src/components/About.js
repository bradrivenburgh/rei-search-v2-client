        <p>
          Real estate investment decisions should always begin with proper due
          diligence. This app is meant to be used by investors interested in
          buying rental real estate in and around Philadelphia, PA. Users will
          be able to discover and evaluate key statistics about the population
          and economy of municipalities in this geography. They will also be
          able to view properties for sale and catalogue them for later viewing.

        <p>
          The app produces statistical data primarily on two geographic levels:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan
              Statistical Area:
            </strong>{" "}
            MSAs are geographic regions centered around areas of high population
            density (i.e., big cities) with integrated economies. The
            Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD MSA will provide
            investors with useful context when viewing comparable Census Tract
            statistics.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Census Tracts:</strong> a CT is a smaller geographic unit
            used for statistical purposes by the US Census Bureau, often
            correlating closely to city town boundaries. The more granular focus
            will provide investors with a better idea of how a municipality
            compares to the MSA as a whole.
          </li>
        </ul>
